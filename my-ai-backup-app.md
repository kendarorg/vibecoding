GENERATED LOADS OF USELESSS STUFFS

Add the following missing implementations
* ActivityDirectoryExplorerBinding
* ActivityJobEditBinding
* ActivityScheduleEditBinding
* ActivityRemoteTargetExplorerBinding

Generated the xml but not the classes

Took only the permission

GENERATED LOADS OF USELESSS STUFFS (not used)

Fix the compilation problems

GENERATED THE DATA BINDINGS

* Some random classes GENERATED
* Not usable...

Fix the compilation erros

NO GOOD ANSWER

#file:ActivityDirectoryExplorerBinding.java #file:ActivityJobEditBinding.java #file:ActivityRemoteTargetExplorerBinding.java #file:ActivityScheduleEditBinding.java  
the view models are missing

=========================================

RETURNING BACK ON START

Just kept the permissions

### Prompt A01

* Use Java as language
* Given a jobs.json file on the application storage containing a list of object with the following fields
** UUID id
** String name
** String lastExecution
** int lastTransferred
* Create a new fragment, view model, layout in package com.kendar.sync.ui.jobslist that 
** Show the list of items with a button to Edit/Delete/Show the item
** Show a "+" button on top to Add
* If not existing the file will be created and contains an empty list
* Prepare empty fragments for the Add/Edit/Show
* For the Delete ask confirmation

THIS WAS MOSTLY OK

Just had to "merge" the whole thing and add the views on the menus

### Prompt A02

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Navigation destination com.kendar.sync:id/addJobFragment referenced from action com.kendar.sync:id/action_jobsListFragment_to_addJobFragment cannot be found from the current destination Destination(com.kendar.sync:id/jobsListFragment) label=Jobs List class=com.kendar.sync.ui.jobslist.JobsListFragment

TOTALLY USELESS

### Prompt A03

### Prompt A06

Design a user interface form titled "Backup Schedule" that allows users to configure and manage backup task schedules. The form should include the following sections and functionality:

Show the fields based on the dropdown selection. All fields show the following (optional) fields

* Start datetime (default now)
* End datetime (default null, meaning never)
* Retry attemps (default 0)
* Wait between retries HH:MM (when attempts is greater than 0)
* Next schedule according to the selection currently shown

Provide dropdown to select one of the following modes:

* Periodic
	* HH:MM Between executiob
* Daily
	* HH:MM At wich the job start
* Weekly
	* checkboxes for days of the week (Sun to Sat) . Multiple allowed
	* HH:MM At wich the job start
* Monthly
	* checkbox grid to select dates (1â€“31) . Multiple allowed
	* HH:MM At wich the job start
* On startup

The storage format of the data will be

M:[MODE] W:[TIME]/[DAY1,DAY2...] P:[STARTDATE]/[ENDDATE] R:[RETRYTRUE_FALSE]/[RETRYWAIT]

Opening the schedule page with a schedule defined will show the correct dropdown selection and data

If not valid expression a Toast will be issued and the schedule will be set to null

### Prompt A07

* If a job is running should wait its end to start again (no overlapping of the same job)


### FIx A07

* Clarifyng the schedule service run style
* Some cleanup
* Lib included as library from maven central
