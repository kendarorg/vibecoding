All prompts are BRAVE!

### Prompt 001

Should create a java system to backup and synchronize files from a client to server
* The client and server will communicate via TCP protocol
* Multiple clients can connect at once, but only one client can access a single backup target location
* The maximum packet size will be in server settings
* The packet fields will be the following
	* Integer: length of the packet including itself
	* Integer: The connection id (used to parallelize the communication. Starts from 0 for the connection )
  * UUID: The session id (defined in the connection phase, is unique for the whole session)
  * Integer: packet id used when sending data in multiple blocks
  * char[2]: containing the type of message
  * byte[]: containing the zipped content of the message. Can be anything needed
* The handshake and termination of the process will be on the same connection
* The client, will create multiple TCP connections to optimize network usage during transfers
* The server will not store previous versions of the files
* If the connection is interrupted the partially uploaded files will be removed
* The functionalities will be
  * Backup/Restore without deleting old files
  * Backup/Restore deleting the files not present on source
  * Backup/Restore without deleting old files with "date separated strucuture" on backup
    * Doing backup will get the date of the file and create a directory strucure based on dates
    * Doing backup Inside the single date the original directory strucuture will be kept
    * Doing restore will place the files directly in the target directory discarding the dates
* The project will be composed by three modules
  * sync-lib: With the protocol definition and common parts
  * sync-client: The client, runnable from command line
  * sync-server: The server, runnable from command line
* The server will have a settings.json containing
  * The listening port of the server
  * The maximum packet size
  * The maximum parallel TCP connections for a single session
  * The list of uniqueid, user, password (and weather they are admin or not)
  * The target folders with 
    * "virtual" name
    * Real path
    * Type of backup
    * Id of the users allowed to backup to/restore from
* The protocol flows will be
  * Backup
    * Client Connect with login, password, and "virtual" target
    * Server Accept or refuse the connection checking the settings for the folder and permissions
    * Client send the list of files, the maximum packet size and the maximum parallel TCP connections allowed
      * This can be splitted in multiple packets if exceeding the maximum packet size
    * Server 
      * check what files will need and eventually remove the files non existing on client
      * send back the list of files that are missing
      * This can be splitted in multiple packets if exceeding the maximum packet size
    * Client create the parallel connections and  
    * For each file
      * Client send the descriptor of the file (name,path,size,modification time, creation time)
      * Server create (eventually) the directory according to the backup type and Acknowledge
      * Client send the file content (eventually in multiple blocks), reading a max of "maximum packet size". This will result in a packet smaller than maximum packet size because of the zipping of content
      * Server 
        * Append the data to the target file ( or create it if this is the packet 0)
        * Set the modification and creation time to "1970-01-01 00:00:00" to force rewriting
      * Client send the End of file packet
      * Server set the real modification time and creation time from the client and acknowledge
    * Client, When all ack are received for all files, send the "End of sync" packet
    * Server receives the message and disconnect
  * Restore  
    * Client Connect with login, password, and "virtual" target
    * Server Accept or refuse the connection checking the settings for the folder and permissions
    * Client send the list of files, the maximum packet size and the maximum parallel TCP connections allowed
      * This can be splitted in multiple packets if exceeding the maximum packet size
    * Server 
      * check what files need to update and what need to remove on client 
      * send back the list of files that are missing or must be removed on client
      * This can be splitted in multiple packets if exceeding the maximum packet size
    * Client 
      * create the parallel connections
      * delete the files to remove
    * For each file
      * Client
        * create the directory for the file
        * send the descriptor of the file (name,path,size,modification time, creation time) it needs to download
      * Server send the file content (eventually in multiple blocks), reading a max of "maximum packet size". This will result in a packet smaller than maximum packet size because of the zipping of content
      * Client 
        * Append the data to the target file ( or create it if this is the packet 0)
        * Set the modification and creation time to "1970-01-01 00:00:00" to force rewriting
      * Server send the End of file packet
      * Client set the real modification time and creation time from the client and acknowledge
    * Client, When all ack are received for all files, send the "End of sync" packet
    * Server receives the message and disconnect
* The serve will expose an authenticate REST API
  * Upon login a token will be generate valid for 30 minutes
  * All the REST APIs will require the token inside the X-Auth-Token header
  * The API will allow CRUD operations on
    * Backup folders
    * Users
    * Max threads
    * Max packet size
  * The user will have the roles
    * admin: all access to all backups and all apis
    * usermanager: access only to user manager apis, and associating users with backups
    * user: access only to api to modify its password and login
	
	
### Prompt 002

Do the following modifications
* On sync-lib
  * Add the possibility for a "dry-run" if not present
* On sync-server
  * Create the main class. It should start
    * If no settings file is given create a default one with one administrator user
    * The TCP server and listen to request to backup/restore and transfer files in an async way
    * The web server for configuration
  * Allow the possibility for a "dry-run" to test the operation
  * Use the protocol specified in sync-lib
* On sync-client
  * Create the main class
  * Add the parser for the command line that should allow (with parameters)
    * Choose the target and source folder
    * Choose if should backup or restore
    * Set the backup server address and port
    * Set the login and password for the 
    * Choose if it should do a "dry-run" or a real backup/restore
  * Start the backup/restore
  * Use the protocol specified in sync-lib
  

### Fix 002

Fixed poms properties

```Quota for Pro is 84%```

### Prompt 003 (twice because of network issues)

Generate the unit testes for the projects. If a real storage is needed use as a root the 'target/tests/UniqueId' directory for each test

```Quota for Pro is 77%```
  
### Fix 003

Mostly fixing unit tests and a weird behaviour on file listing

### Prompt 004 

Fix the failing unit tests for the module sync-client, use a fake socket, no real socket allowed in unit tests

### Fix 004 

Fix all the tests by hand AI went in loopholes

### Prompt 005

* Create the backup integration test on sync-server that
	* Setup a source directory with random files and nested dirs
	* Setup a target directory
	* Start the server
	* Start the client and start the backup
	* Verify that everything is backed up
	* Remove some file from the source
	* Start the client and do the restore

```Completely failed```

### Fix 005

* Extract the server to be run programmatically
* Extract the client to be run programmatically
* Modify the test to run with the new approach

### Prompt 006

* Create one class for each backup type to be used in Server.java with implementation and unit test
	
```Quota for Pro is 52%```
Mostly done but without 

### Now with Copilot-Claude

* List all the directories child of directory "source" that match the pattern [0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}
* List all the files inside a directory recursively

### Fix 007

* Implement most of backup handlers
