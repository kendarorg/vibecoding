Uploading images, calculate the md5 of the file and use that as the filename instead of the UUID
=================== NOPE
* On the backend the filename should be [File MD5].[extension] instead of [UUID].[extension]
* When uploading images the calculated name of the file should be passed back 
* When elaborating src images inside html should upload the image and -after that- use the obtained name as link
==================== HALT
  please use md5 or md5_file do not create crap
=================== HALT
* uploadImage inside index.php
