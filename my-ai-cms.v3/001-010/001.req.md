</prerequisites>
<functionalities>
* Browsing
    * The data directory content is shown on a plain php page
    * The query parameter "p" will be used to decide what branch of tree to show
    * Inside the local storage will be stored all the branches currently opened
        * The "status" will contain a property "opened" that will contain all opened branches
    * Clicking on a closed branch will add a line on the status.opened and will refresh the page
    * Clicking on an opened branch will remove (if exists) the corresponding line on the status.opened and will refresh the page
    * Loading the page with the tree will load all opened branches in status
* Right click
    * The right click will be implemented with the "oncontextmenu" attribute
    * Right clicking on an item will open a javascript context menu with the following choices
        * Add branch
        * Remove branch
        * Rename branch
    * All the right click actions must be implemented
