Need to add a minimal file handling
</shortdescription>
<description>
* The file naming convention should be the same as the branches naming convention, which is UUID with a line in the names.log.
* The names.log should not be visible in the tree.
* The files should be listed under their respective branches.
* The file extension will be "md"
* The file extension will not be shown
* On branches menu will be added "Add file"
* For files context menu will be added: 
    * "Remove file" following the same logic of branches for names.log
    * "Rename file" following the same logic of branches for names.log
